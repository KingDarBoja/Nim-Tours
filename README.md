# Welcome to the Nim Tours

This repository aims to provide a basic tour of Nim features. This is based on [PMunch/nimtours](https://github.com/PMunch/nimtours) repository.

The main goal should be writing and testing some tours to showcase Nim features and also provide a small spanish translation tutorial.

This is mostly a test so don't expect too much from this repository.

## Writing new tours

The playground supports showing a tour hosted anywhere. So to see how a tour will look before comitting it to this repo simply upload it somewhere (could even be a paste-site like https://ix.io) and go to `https://play.nim-lang.org/#tour=<URL escaped link to the tour>`
